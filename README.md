Introducing ComCore! Your stop for elevating your style and finding your unique fashion sense! At ComCore, we are passionate about bringing the latest trends in clothing to your fingertips!

## Design Process

This online e-shop is designed for shoppers who want to get the latest clothings in trend, we cater to a younger audience as we have celebrities and models that the younger generation might be more familiar with. These celebrities are well known around the younger generations and can thus attract the youth to explore our e-shop.

Our main idea was to do a e-commerce website that allowed users to shop at this online store whilst also giving it a more modern feel, we also included a trivia section to allow users to test their knowledge on their favourite celebrities, with the questions being based around celebrity fashion.

## Features

We have 3 pages, homepage, shop page, trivia page

- The homepage is our mainpage and it shows 
- The shop page uses WebAPI to display a shop page that has a number of products, it comes with a cart page which allows the user to select products on the main shop page and add it to their cart in the cart page. 
- The trivia page is our feature for gamification. The trivia page allows for shopgoers to play a 10 question multiple choice trivia that tests on the famous celebrities and their fashion. The quiz focuses on celebrity fashion, which ties back to the main theme of our idea, which is trendy and up-to-date fashion, which is prominent amongst celebrities and the youth.

### Existing Features

#### Homepage
- There is a 3 image carousell that fades in and out automatically.
- There is a gallery scroll function that shows models.

#### Shop page
- There is a catalogue of items that the shop sells, which shopgoers can select and add to their cart.
- In the cart page, the shopgoers can view the items they selected and see their total cost.

#### Trivia page
- There is a 10 question quiz in the Trivia Page which users can test their knowledge on their favourite celebrities.
- Once quiz is done, score is displayed and user can choose to play again.

### Features left to implement 
- Another feature idea could be implementing a log in page using RestDB.
- There could also be a voucher function/rewards function that ties back into a user's account and he can choose to use it in the cart page when they are paying for products, and it discounts accordingly.


## Technologies used
- We used HTML, CSS and Javascript as our main coding languages.
- We used FakeStoreAPI to generate a store catalogue that we used in our shop page.
