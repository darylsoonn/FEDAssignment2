Introducing ComCore! Your stop for elevating your style and finding your unique fashion sense! At ComCore, we are passionate about bringing the latest trends in clothing to your fingertips!

## Design Process

This online e-shop is designed for shoppers who want to get the latest clothings in trend, we cater to a younger audience as we have celebrities and models that the younger generation might be more familiar with. These celebrities are well known around the younger generations and can thus attract the youth to explore our e-shop.

Our main idea was to do a e-commerce website that allowed users to shop at this online store whilst also giving it a more modern feel, we also included a trivia section to allow users to test their knowledge on their favourite celebrities, with the questions being based around celebrity fashion.
